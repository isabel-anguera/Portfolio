      Hi there! My name is Isabel Anguera. I am currently a senior at Parsons
      School of Design, studying both Design and Technology, and Culture and
      Media Studies. I love working in web development, UX/UI, and interaction
      design, and think that merging design with social change/commentary is
      awesome. I am based in New York, though I have lived in a few different
      places throughout my life, including Peru, Portugal, and a few different
      East coast states in the US. I love meeting new people and learning from
      them and I can't wait to be a part of a super cool team!
