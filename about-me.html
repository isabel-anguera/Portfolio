          Hi there! My name is Isabel Anguera. I am currently a senior at
          Parsons School of Design, studying both Design and Technology, and
          Culture and Media Studies. I love working in web development, UX/UI,
          interaction design, and merging design with social change/commentary.
          I am based in New York, though I have lived in a few different places
          throughout my life, including Peru, Portugal, and a couple of
          different East coast states in the US. I love meeting new people and
          learning from them and I can't wait to be a part of a super cool team!
