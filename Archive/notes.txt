Left to do:
- Decide on structure for if you want a gallery of photos/screenshots 
  instead of 2 rows of 2 columns
- Set up folder structure so that everything can be transfered and moved easily
- Sort out filtering for project types
- Active sliders for pages and filtering
- Extra pages (keep similar to current portfolio)
