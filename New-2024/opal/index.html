                In the height of the NFT hype, Opal aimed to make the industry 
                accessible and social. The complex, looming world of crypto had a 
                creative outlet, and the founders of Opal saw it as an opportunity for 
                people to connect and engage with one another through it by creating an 
                 NFT-based social platform.

                The first step to any platform is the onboarding flow. We wanted users
                to feel ready to go straight away, so from the start, we introduce them to 
                the platform, allow them to set up their profile, connect wallets, and 
                start following content relevant to what theyâ€™re interested in seeing!

                So let's talk retention! We introduced gamification mechanisms 
                into the platform in order to drive user engagement and create 
                a more active user base. By providing users Daily Quests through 
                which they could earn rewards, we encouraged them to interact both 
                with the platform and with other users. </p>

                <p>Once we had user flows and wireframes, to ensure design consistency 
                    and a cohesive brand identity, we established a design library. 
                    As a team of 2 designers, within a week we had one fleshed out that 
                    took scalability and future growth into account while remaining flexible
                    to the dynamic nature of an early-stage platform.
