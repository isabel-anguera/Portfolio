                <p>Hopping on the phone with sales for any Telco is a looming task 
                    for most. It's become a notorious, and long process. So we're working 
                    with this client to change that by making talking to sales a short and 
                    productive experience—one that's pleasant for both sales agent and customer. 
                    How are we doing that? We improve the time it takes for the agent to put 
                    together a proposal, we design a product with performance in mind, and we 
                    look at gaps in the process and fill them with new and improved flows.</p>

            <div class = "column">
                <p>The existing platform used by the sales team today does not allow users 
                    to replace an offer with another. They instead must remove the offer they 
                    want to replace, add a new one, and make the changes to that new offer to 
                    match the one they've removed. Sounds complicated, so we developed a 
                    "Replace" feature that folds that all into one action. In the new experience, 
                    a user has the option to "Replace" an offer as a dedicated action, opening 
                    a modal-based flow in which they select a new offer, and can compare the two in a 
                    side-by-side view without having to leave the page or re-do the changes they 
                    made previously.</p>

                <p>Our client has a mix of products and offers—some simple, others 
                    not so much—but there are a lot of them. Because of this, we were 
                    tasked with looking at these products and how they're built in the 
                    back-end, to design a generic framework for how to present them to 
                    the user in a clear, performance-friendly way. We evaluated products and
                    use cases, and introduced new patterns that would account for growing complexity, 
                    all in a new screen that consolidates all the actions a user may need while 
                    attending to a customer.</p>

                <p>In Telco, there are a lot of moving parts and dependencies. In order for 
                    one thing to work, we need another to be working elsewhere, or equipment 
                    to enable services. This can get unruly for our sales users, so we 
                    introduced a feature where users have access to that information, and 
                    with that, an entry point into any necessary actions they may need to take—like
                    replace maybe?</p>

In order to shorten a user’s laundry process, and encourage efficiency within the laundry system itself, the timer starts when the user’s machine is started and will be set automatically so that the user doesn’t forget to set one, or have to think about it.</p>
