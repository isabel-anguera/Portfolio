                <p>Sportswear is a competitive industry that moves fast and where you don't want 
                    to get left behind. This company needed an extra set of hands to support 
                    the design team, so I stepped in and became another teammate working to 
                    reach our collective goals! From the modernization of their Shop App, to 
                    a full tool migration and design library re-build, we got it done and had 
                    fun doing it!</p>

                <p>This project was split into two primary parts: Shop App, and 
                    Web. During my time with the Shop app team, we supported refactoring 
                    efforts for a true cross-platform experience, 
                    and a visual re-design that included establishing a new and 
                    improved design library, and testing with users to iterate on concepts
                    and design direction.</p>

                <p>Part two, I moved on to the Web team, where there was more regulation 
                    and more moving parts. As everything kept moving, the team 
                    was split on design tools, with some designers using Figma and others Sketchâ€”it was
                    tough to keep track of changes and keep up to date files. I carried out 
                    a full migration of their library and all design assets, aka thousands of screens, 
                    moving them all into Figma and rebuilding the library entirely to ensure 
                    easier transitions in the case of growth and to account for scalability. The library
                and existing screens were all optimized to take advantage of Figma's capabilities, 
                with no disruption to ongoing work and time left over to support the team elsewhere.</p>
